### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm (trying to be) a cheminformatics data scientist working at [@Roche](https://github.com/Roche) as post doctorate scientist. 
I have been doing cheminformatic development since 2008 in C/C++ and python.

I'm a linux/unix entusiast and an opensource supporter.
My favorite linux distributions are Gentoo, Debian, Fedora and my prefered desktop environment is KDE plasma.

To name few of my open-source contributions:
* [DeepMolecularNetwork](https://github.com/gmrandazzo/DeepMolecularNetwork) some commandline software to build deep learning models and make predictions using tabular values, images, smiles string and voxel molecular representations
* [QStudioMetrics](https://github.com/gmrandazzo/QStudioMetrics) a software for doing multivariate statistical analysis (PCA/PLS)
* [PyLSS](https://github.com/gmrandazzo/PyLSS) a software that implement the [LSS theory developed by Dolan and Snyder](https://www.chromatographytoday.com/article/bioanalytical/40/imre_molnr_hans-jrgen_rieger_rbert_kormny/chromatography_modelling_in_high_performance_liquid_chromatography_method_development/1387) to run liquid chromatography modelling
* [MolecularFramework](https://github.com/gmrandazzo/MolecularFramework) a C/C++ library/tool to run molecular modelling and cheminformatic QSAR/QSPR modelling
* [libscientific](https://github.com/gmrandazzo/libscientific) a C library that implement the multivariate analysis algorithms and also other numerical algorithms (Python bindings availables).
* [ChemSpaceTracker](https://github.com/gmrandazzo/ChemSpaceTracker) a tool to build and visualize chemical spaces using principal component analysis and molecular descriptors
* [MsMsSpectralAnalysis](https://github.com/gmrandazzo/MsMsSpectralAnalysis) a tool to analyze and compare MS/MS fragmentation spectra with databases 
* [DynMetId](https://github.com/gmrandazzo/DynMetId) a metabolite tool identification that power the web engine [Dynasti](https://dynasti.vital-it.ch/)
* and so on... 

During my free time I enjoy staying with my family, playing french horn, hacking my old computers and actively supporting the open-source community as I can: [Linux](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-wireless/20200405220659.45621-1-chunkeey@gmail.com/#r), [Mindguard](https://github.com/asbestomolesto/mindguard), ...
